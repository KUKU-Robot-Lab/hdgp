You are an expert in robotics, reinforcement learning and code generation.

We control a bimanual robot: two 7-DOF OpenArm arms, each carrying an Inspire RH56F1 five-finger \
hand, standing at a table. The RH56F1 is an UNDER-ACTUATED hand: only 6 joints per hand are driven \
(thumb abduction, thumb flexion, and one flexion drive for each of the index, middle, ring and pinky \
fingers); the remaining finger joints follow the driven ones through fixed mechanical couplings, so a \
finger always curls as a whole. The RIGHT arm is the "source" arm (src_*), the LEFT arm is the \
"receiver" arm (rcv_*). Two identical cups stand on the table: the source cup (in front of the right \
hand, filled with 20 small beads) and the receiver cup (in front of the left hand, empty). \
Positions are in metres in a frame whose origin is at the robot base; +z is up, +x is forward (away \
from the robot), +y is to the robot's left. The table top is at z = table_z.

The action space is a normalized `Box(-1, 1, (24,), float32)`:
  actions[0:6]   = source palm 6-DoF target offset (xyz + yaw/pitch/roll) — the arm is moved \
by a geometric-fabrics controller toward this target
  actions[6:12]  = source hand closure commands, one per driven joint \
(thumb abduction, thumb flexion, index, middle, ring, pinky; 0 = open, 1 = closed)
  actions[12:18] = receiver palm 6-DoF target offset
  actions[18:24] = receiver hand closure commands
The hand controller stops a finger automatically once one of its links touches its own cup \
(contact freeze), so a closing command produces a wrap-around power grasp; opening is always \
allowed. Fingers can only close when the palm is near its cup. The hand opening between the thumb \
and the four fingers is about 10 cm when open and the cups are about 7 cm in diameter, so the cup \
must be placed well inside the hand before closing.

Now I want you to help me write a reward function for reinforcement learning.

Typically, the reward function of a manipulation task consists of these parts (some are optional — include them only if really necessary):
1. the distance between the robot's hand and the target object (one term per arm)
2. the difference between the object's current state and its goal state
3. regularization of the robot's action
4. [optional] extra constraints on the target objects implied by the task (e.g. keep the receiver cup upright, do not spill)
5. [optional] extra constraints on the robot implied by the task

The reward function receives a single argument `ctx`, an instance of this class (all positions env-local, metres; angles rad; forces N):

Additional knowledge:
1. Everything is BATCHED: every tensor field has a leading dimension N (number of parallel environments). The function must return a reward tensor of shape (N,) — never a Python float — and a dict of named component tensors, each of shape (N,). Use only `torch` and `math`; do not import anything else.
2. Write staged rewards with tensor masks, not `if`/`else` on tensors: `stage2 = torch.where(ctx.src_grasped, r_lift, torch.zeros_like(r_lift))`.
3. Prefer bounded, smooth shaping: `torch.exp(-k * dist)` or `1 - torch.tanh(k * dist)` instead of raw negative distances, so that no single term dominates.
4. `ctx.src_grasped` / `ctx.rcv_grasped` are True when the thumb AND another finger both press on that hand's own cup — this is the grasp-established signal. `ctx.*_hand_closure` is the measured closure (0 = open, 1 = fully closed).
5. Cup tilt: `ctx.src_cup_tilt` is the angle between the cup's up axis and world +z (0 = upright, π/2 = horizontal). Beads leave the source cup once it is tilted past roughly 110° (1.9 rad) with its mouth over the receiver cup's mouth. `ctx.src_cup_mouth_pos` and `ctx.rcv_cup_mouth_pos` are the rim centres.
6. Bead bookkeeping: `bead_in_target_frac` rises as beads land in the receiver cup; `bead_spill_frac` counts beads lost outside both cups (permanent). `d_in_target` and `d_spill` are this step's increments — reward INCREMENTS of beads transferred rather than the level, otherwise the policy is paid for standing still with a filled cup.
7. `ctx.success` is computed by the environment (enough beads in the receiver cup, little spill, cups close together, and the cups NOT nested). You may add a bonus on it but you cannot redefine it. Beads only count as "in the receiver" once they have LEFT the source cup — pushing the source cup into the receiver cup (`ctx.cups_nested`) transfers nothing and is never a success; the beads must fall out of the tilted source cup through the air.
8. Height above the table: `ctx.src_cup_pos[:, 2] - ctx.src_cup_spawn_pos[:, 2]` is how far the source cup has been lifted (0 while it rests on the table).
9. Do not keep any state between calls (no globals, no attributes); the function must be pure.
10. Each component you return is logged separately during training and shown back to you after training, so name them meaningfully (e.g. "approach_src", "grasp_rcv", "pour_delta").
11. This policy will be deployed on the real robot, so collisions are a safety hazard: `ctx.cup_cup_force` is the contact force between the two cups, and `ctx.src_hand_foreign_force` / `ctx.rcv_hand_foreign_force` are the forces each hand exerts on anything other than its own cup (the other hand, the other cup, the table). During a correct pour the cups do not touch each other and the hands touch only their own cup; penalise these forces (bounded, e.g. `torch.tanh(f / 5.0)`) so the policy learns to keep clearance. Cup poses seen by the policy are delayed and noisy as on the real perception system.

I want it to fulfil the following task: Using both arms, grasp each cup: the right hand grasps the source cup (which contains the beads) and the left hand grasps the empty receiver cup. Lift both cups off the table, bring the mouth of the source cup over the mouth of the receiver cup, and tilt the source cup so that the beads pour into the receiver cup. Keep the receiver cup upright, do not drop either cup, and spill as few beads as possible. The task is finished when at least half of the beads are inside the receiver cup with little spill.
1. Please think step by step and tell me what this task means and which stages the robot must go through.
2. Then write a function with exactly this signature:
```python
def compute_reward(ctx: RewardContext) -> tuple[torch.Tensor, dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    ...
    return reward, {"component_name": component_tensor, ...}
```
   where `reward` has shape (N,) and every dict value has shape (N,).
3. Take care of tensor shapes and types; never call methods that are not listed in the class definition above.
4. Put the final code in ONE ```python fenced block that starts with `import torch` and `import math` and contains only the function (plus small helper functions if needed). Add short comments explaining weights, e.g. `# weight 0.5 works together with the pour term 5.0 — pouring must dominate once grasped`.
