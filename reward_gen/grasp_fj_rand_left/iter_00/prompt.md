You are an expert in robotics, reinforcement learning and code generation.

We control one 7-DOF OpenArm robot arm (the left arm) carrying a five-finger Tesollo DG-5F hand, standing at a table. +x points from the robot toward the table. Every episode starts with the arm raised beside the robot: the palm is just outside the table edge nearest the robot, about 0.25 m above the table top, turned sideways, with the fingers pointing forward over the table edge. A cup stands upright on the table at a position drawn uniformly at random for every episode, with x between 0.10 m and 0.40 m and y between 0.00 m and 0.30 m, so at the start the palm is anywhere from about 0.15 m to 0.49 m from the cup (0.31 m on average) and the hand has to go to wherever the cup is; ctx.cup_pos gives its position. Near the far corners of that region (y close to 0.30 m, or x close to 0.40 m) the arm may need the hand turned by up to about 40 degrees from its start orientation to reach the cup's +y side. Parallel environments use different cups (open cups of several sizes and a closed shaker), so the graspable radius (44 mm to 81 mm) and half height (42 mm to 65 mm) differ between environments and are given per environment. There is only this one start pose: approach_done is never set when an episode starts. Positions are in metres in each environment's local frame, with +z pointing up; the table top is at z = table_z.

The action space is a normalized `Box(-1, 1, (26,), float32)` with direct joint control. There is no grasp primitive, no hand synergy and no automatic finger stopping:
    actions[0:7]  = arm joint increments: each arm joint target moves by 0.05 * a rad per step and then passes a first-order filter (factor 0.1), so each arm joint moves at most about 0.3 rad/s.
    actions[7:26] = finger joint targets: each value is mapped linearly onto that joint's commandable range (a = -1 gives the lower limit, a = +1 the upper limit) and then low-pass filtered (factor 0.1). The order, which is also the order of ctx.hand_q / hand_q_norm / hand_target_norm / hand_qd, is:
    actions[ 7] = hand index  0: l_hj_thumb_2   range [+1.561, +1.581] rad  locked
    actions[ 8] = hand index  1: l_hj_thumb_3   range [-1.571, +0.000] rad  movable
    actions[ 9] = hand index  2: l_hj_thumb_4   range [-1.571, +0.000] rad  movable
    actions[10] = hand index  3: l_hj_index_1   range [-0.010, +0.010] rad  locked
    actions[11] = hand index  4: l_hj_index_2   range [+0.000, +2.007] rad  movable
    actions[12] = hand index  5: l_hj_index_3   range [+0.000, +1.571] rad  movable
    actions[13] = hand index  6: l_hj_index_4   range [+0.000, +1.571] rad  movable
    actions[14] = hand index  7: l_hj_middle_1  range [-0.010, +0.010] rad  locked
    actions[15] = hand index  8: l_hj_middle_2  range [+0.000, +2.007] rad  movable
    actions[16] = hand index  9: l_hj_middle_3  range [+0.000, +1.571] rad  movable
    actions[17] = hand index 10: l_hj_middle_4  range [+0.000, +1.571] rad  movable
    actions[18] = hand index 11: l_hj_ring_1    range [-0.010, +0.010] rad  locked
    actions[19] = hand index 12: l_hj_ring_2    range [+0.000, +1.920] rad  movable
    actions[20] = hand index 13: l_hj_ring_3    range [+0.000, +1.571] rad  movable
    actions[21] = hand index 14: l_hj_ring_4    range [+0.000, +1.571] rad  movable
    actions[22] = hand index 15: l_hj_pinky_1   range [-0.010, +0.000] rad  locked
    actions[23] = hand index 16: l_hj_pinky_2   range [-0.010, +0.010] rad  locked
    actions[24] = hand index 17: l_hj_pinky_3   range [+0.000, +1.571] rad  movable
    actions[25] = hand index 18: l_hj_pinky_4   range [+0.000, +1.571] rad  movable
Joints marked "locked" have a range of 0.05 rad or less and effectively do not move. The thumb's first joint is welded in this hand; `thumb_2`, which rotates the thumb into opposition, is locked at the opposed angle, and the thumb flexes with `thumb_3` and `thumb_4`. On the index, middle and ring fingers `_1` spreads the finger sideways (locked), `_2` flexes the knuckle, and `_3` and `_4` flex the two outer joints. On the pinky, `pinky_1` and `pinky_2` are locked and the finger flexes with `pinky_3` and `pinky_4`. On this left hand, `thumb_3` and `thumb_4` flex towards negative angles (a more negative angle is a more flexed thumb); for every other movable joint a larger angle means a more flexed (more closed) finger. ctx.hand_q_norm, hand_target_norm and hand_default_q_norm are nevertheless oriented the same way for every joint: 0 = straight, 1 = most flexed. The finger joints are position-controlled (PD), so a finger that meets the cup stops there and presses with a force that grows with the gap between its target angle and its actual angle. One control step is 1/60 s.

Now I want you to help me write a reward function for reinforcement learning.

Typically, the reward function of a manipulation task consists of these parts (some are optional — include them only if really necessary):
1. the distance between the robot's hand and the target object
2. the difference between the object's current state and its goal state
3. regularization of the robot's action
4. [optional] extra constraints on the target object implied by the task
5. [optional] extra constraints on the robot implied by the task

The reward function receives a single argument `ctx`, an instance of this class (all positions env-local, metres; angles rad; forces N):

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class RewardContext:
    # ---- constants (python numbers, fixed for the whole run) ---------------------------
    table_z: float                 # height of the table top [m]
    lift_latch_height: float       # the env sets `lifted` once the cup has risen this far above its starting height [m]
    success_hold_steps: int        # consecutive steps with goal_dist <= success_tol needed to count one success; a success also requires, on that step, that the fingers are wrapped around the cup (the env measures how far the finger links enclose the cup body and requires it above a threshold that starts low and rises as the policy succeeds more often)
    max_successes: int             # the episode ends after this many successes

    # ---- hand: left Tesollo DG-5F, finger index 0 thumb, 1 index, 2 middle, 3 ring, 4 pinky ----

    palm_side: torch.Tensor        # (N,3) unit vector lying in the palm plane (palm frame y axis)
    palm_finger_dir: torch.Tensor  # (N,3) unit vector lying in the palm plane, pointing from the palm towards the fingers (palm frame z axis); palm_normal, palm_side, palm_finger_dir form a right-handed frame. In the start pose palm_normal points along -y and palm_finger_dir along +x
    link_pos: torch.Tensor         # (N,5,3,3) finger link positions: [:, f, 0] link moved by joint _3, [:, f, 1] link moved by joint _4, [:, f, 2] fingertip

    hand_q: torch.Tensor           # (N,19) finger joint angles [rad], order = the hand joint table in the robot description
    hand_q_norm: torch.Tensor      # (N,19) joint angles normalised to each joint's commandable range: 0 = straight, 1 = most flexed, for every joint (on this left hand thumb_3 and thumb_4 flex towards negative angles, so for them 0 is the upper limit and 1 the lower limit)

    hand_default_q_norm: torch.Tensor  # (N,19) the hand's default pose: the finger joint angles every episode starts with, same normalisation as hand_q_norm (the same in every environment); in this pose the four fingers are straight, and the thumb, rotated into opposition, is straight and points along palm_normal, reaching about 0.12 m out from the palm surface at the wrist end of the palm (behind palm_pos along palm_finger_dir)
    hand_qd: torch.Tensor          # (N,19) finger joint velocities [rad/s]
    hand_z_min: torch.Tensor       # (N,) height of the lowest finger/thumb link [m]; the palm is not included in this one
    palm_clearance: torch.Tensor   # (N,) height of the lowest point of the palm itself above the table top [m]: 0 means the palm is resting on the table, negative means it is pressed into it. The palm is a large flat body and palm_pos is a virtual point up to 0.065 m away from its surface, so palm_pos alone cannot tell you whether the palm is on the table; this is the measured distance. Note that the episode-ending floor check looks only at the finger and thumb links, so the palm resting on the table does not end the episode by itself

Episodes that start beside the cup (see the scene description) have approach_done already set on the first step
    envelope_done: torch.Tensor    # (N,) bool, set once, after approach_done, the palm, the thumb and at least 4 digits in total (the thumb included) touched the cup for 5 consecutive steps; the palm or a finger counts as touching when its contact force with the cup is above 0.1 N

Additional knowledge:
1. Everything is BATCHED: every tensor field has a leading dimension N (number of parallel environments). The function must return a reward tensor of shape (N,) — never a Python float — and a dict of named component tensors, each of shape (N,). Use only `torch` and `math`; do not import anything else.
2. Write staged rewards with tensor masks, not `if`/`else` on tensors, e.g. `staged = torch.where(ctx.lifted, r_hold, torch.zeros_like(r_hold))`.
3. Prefer bounded, smooth shaping such as `torch.exp(-k * dist)` or `1 - torch.tanh(k * dist)` instead of raw negative distances, so that no single term dominates.
4. Contact: `ctx.link_cup_force[:, f, k]` is the contact force between link k (0 the link moved by joint `_3`, 1 the link moved by joint `_4`, 2 the fingertip) of finger f (0 thumb, 1 index, 2 middle, 3 ring, 4 pinky) and the cup, and `ctx.palm_cup_force` the force between the palm and the cup. Contact is measured only on these links and the palm — the finger links nearest the palm are not measured. Contacts with anything else (the table, the hand itself) are not included. A value of 0 means that link is not touching the cup. Contact forces come from the physics engine each step and can spike. These forces are only available to the reward; the policy itself does not observe contact.
5. Cylinder geometry (the cups are roughly cylindrical): for a point p (e.g. `ctx.link_pos[:, f, k]`), with `v = p - ctx.cup_pos`, the axial coordinate is `h = (v * ctx.cup_axis).sum(-1)` and the radial vector is `v - h.unsqueeze(-1) * ctx.cup_axis`; its norm is the distance from the cup axis. The cup surface is at `ctx.cup_radius` and the graspable band is `|h| <= ctx.cup_half_height`. The palm normal `ctx.palm_normal` points out of the palm.
6. Height: `ctx.cup_pos[:, 2] - ctx.cup_spawn_pos[:, 2]` is how far the cup has been raised above its starting height (0 while it rests on the table). `ctx.lifted` becomes True once that height exceeds `ctx.lift_latch_height` and stays True for the rest of the episode, even if the cup is dropped again.
7. Goal and success are computed by the environment and cannot be redefined by the reward. The goal position is 0.21 m to 0.28 m above the cup's starting position and at most 5 cm away from it horizontally, with the cup upright. A success is counted when `ctx.goal_dist <= ctx.success_tol` for `ctx.success_hold_steps` consecutive steps and, on that same step, the fingers are wrapped around the cup: the environment measures how far the finger links enclose the cup body and requires that measure to be above a threshold, which starts low and rises as the policy succeeds more often. A cup that reaches the goal without being held that way does not count as a success. `ctx.success` is True on the step a success is counted. After a success the next goal is at the same place, so holding the cup still there keeps producing successes until `ctx.max_successes`, which ends the episode. The keypoints are fixed on the cup, so tilting the cup also increases `goal_dist`. `ctx.success_tol` starts at 0.1125 m and shrinks towards 0.015 m as the policy succeeds more often during training. You may add a bonus on `ctx.success`.
8. An episode lasts at most 900 steps (15 s), and the step budget restarts after every success. The episode ends early when the cup falls below z = 0.15 (off the table), leaves the allowed area around the table, or tilts more than 60 degrees; when any hand link goes below z = table_z - 0.005 (wherever the hand is; this check does not include the palm, whose own clearance is ctx.palm_clearance); or when an arm joint goes past its limit or moves faster than 20 rad/s. On that last kind of physics violation the environment replaces the reward of that step with a fixed -1 (your function's value is not used on that step).
9. Do not keep any state between calls (no globals, no attributes); the function must be pure.
10. Each component you return is logged separately during training and may be shown back to you after training, so name components meaningfully (e.g. "approach", "lift", "success_bonus").

I want it to fulfil the following task: Pick up the upright cup in three stages, strictly in this order. The cup is placed at a different position on the table in every episode.
Stage 1, approach: starting from the raised pose beside the table, go to wherever the cup has been placed and bring the hand to it without turning it more than the cup's position requires: keep the hand's start orientation (ctx.palm_normal along -y, towards the cup, and ctx.palm_finger_dir along +x) as closely as the reach allows; the approach accepts up to about 45 degrees of turn. Keep the hand in its default pose (ctx.hand_default_q_norm), so the fingers and the thumb stay open. In the default pose the thumb sticks straight out of the palm towards the cup at the wrist end of the palm, so the hand has to come to the cup's +y side with the cup between the thumb and the four fingers: the palm close to the cup's side, the cup further along the fingers than the thumb, and neither the thumb nor any finger touching the cup yet. The approach is complete when the environment sets ctx.approach_done, which then stays set for the rest of the episode.
Stage 2, envelope grasp: only after the approach is complete, from beside the cup and with the same hand orientation, move the palm against the cup's side and close the hand around the cup into an envelope grasp (a power grasp): the four fingers wrapping around the cup body on the far side with their inner surfaces, and the thumb closing on the near side, opposite the fingers. The environment sets ctx.envelope_done once the palm, the thumb and enough fingers hold the cup for several consecutive steps.
Stage 3, lift: only after the envelope grasp is formed, keep that grasp and lift the cup straight up to the goal position, then hold it there, upright and still, so that the environment keeps counting successes.
No stage may earn reward before the previous stage is complete, and behaviour that skips or reorders the stages must not earn reward. The cups differ in shape and size between environments. Do not knock the cup over, do not drop it, and do not push the hand into the table.
1. Please think step by step and tell me what this task means and which stages the robot must go through.
2. Then write a function with exactly this signature:
```python
def compute_reward(ctx: RewardContext) -> tuple[torch.Tensor, dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    ...
    return reward, {"component_name": component_tensor, ...}
```
   where `reward` has shape (N,) and every dict value has shape (N,).
3. Take care of tensor shapes and types; never access a field or method that is not listed in the class definition above.
4. Put the final code in ONE ```python fenced block that starts with `import torch` and `import math` and contains only the function (plus small helper functions if needed). Add short comments explaining the weights.
