You are an expert in robotics, reinforcement learning and code generation.

We control one 7-DOF OpenArm robot arm (the right arm) carrying a five-finger Tesollo DG-5F hand, standing at a table. An upright cylindrical cup stands on the table in front of the hand; its radius differs between parallel environments (29 mm to 44 mm) and is given per environment. At the start of an episode the palm is roughly 0.15 m from the cup. Positions are in metres in each environment's local frame, with +z pointing up; the table top is at z = table_z.

The action space is a normalized `Box(-1, 1, (26,), float32)` with direct joint control. There is no grasp primitive, no hand synergy and no automatic finger stopping:
    actions[0:7]  = arm joint increments: each arm joint target moves by 0.025 * a rad per step and then passes a first-order filter (factor 0.1), so each arm joint moves at most about 0.15 rad/s.
    actions[7:26] = finger joint targets: each value is mapped linearly onto that joint's commandable range (a = -1 gives the lower limit, a = +1 the upper limit) and then low-pass filtered (factor 0.1). The order, which is also the order of ctx.hand_q / hand_q_norm / hand_target_norm / hand_qd, is:
    actions[ 7] = hand index  0: r_hj_thumb_2   range [-1.581, -1.561] rad  locked
    actions[ 8] = hand index  1: r_hj_thumb_3   range [+0.000, +1.571] rad  movable
    actions[ 9] = hand index  2: r_hj_thumb_4   range [+0.000, +1.571] rad  movable
    actions[10] = hand index  3: r_hj_index_1   range [-0.010, +0.010] rad  locked
    actions[11] = hand index  4: r_hj_index_2   range [+0.000, +2.007] rad  movable
    actions[12] = hand index  5: r_hj_index_3   range [+0.000, +1.571] rad  movable
    actions[13] = hand index  6: r_hj_index_4   range [+0.000, +1.571] rad  movable
    actions[14] = hand index  7: r_hj_middle_1  range [-0.010, +0.010] rad  locked
    actions[15] = hand index  8: r_hj_middle_2  range [+0.000, +2.007] rad  movable
    actions[16] = hand index  9: r_hj_middle_3  range [+0.000, +1.571] rad  movable
    actions[17] = hand index 10: r_hj_middle_4  range [+0.000, +1.571] rad  movable
    actions[18] = hand index 11: r_hj_ring_1    range [-0.010, +0.010] rad  locked
    actions[19] = hand index 12: r_hj_ring_2    range [+0.000, +1.920] rad  movable
    actions[20] = hand index 13: r_hj_ring_3    range [+0.000, +1.571] rad  movable
    actions[21] = hand index 14: r_hj_ring_4    range [+0.000, +1.571] rad  movable
    actions[22] = hand index 15: r_hj_pinky_1   range [+0.000, +0.010] rad  locked
    actions[23] = hand index 16: r_hj_pinky_2   range [-0.010, +0.010] rad  locked
    actions[24] = hand index 17: r_hj_pinky_3   range [+0.000, +1.571] rad  movable
    actions[25] = hand index 18: r_hj_pinky_4   range [+0.000, +1.571] rad  movable
Joints marked "locked" have a range of 0.05 rad or less and effectively do not move. The thumb's first joint is welded in this hand; `thumb_2`, which rotates the thumb into opposition, is locked at the opposed angle, and the thumb flexes with `thumb_3` and `thumb_4`. On the index, middle and ring fingers `_1` spreads the finger sideways (locked), `_2` flexes the knuckle, and `_3` and `_4` flex the two outer joints. On the pinky, `pinky_1` and `pinky_2` are locked and the finger flexes with `pinky_3` and `pinky_4`. For every movable joint a larger angle means a more flexed (more closed) finger. The finger joints are position-controlled (PD), so a finger that meets the cup stops there and presses with a force that grows with the gap between its target angle and its actual angle. One control step is 1/60 s.

Now I want you to help me write a reward function for reinforcement learning.

Typically, the reward function of a manipulation task consists of these parts (some are optional — include them only if really necessary):
1. the distance between the robot's hand and the target object
2. the difference between the object's current state and its goal state
3. regularization of the robot's action
4. [optional] extra constraints on the target object implied by the task
5. [optional] extra constraints on the robot implied by the task

The reward function receives a single argument `ctx`, an instance of this class (all positions env-local, metres; angles rad; forces N):

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class RewardContext:

```

Additional knowledge:
1. Everything is BATCHED: every tensor field has a leading dimension N (number of parallel environments). The function must return a reward tensor of shape (N,) — never a Python float — and a dict of named component tensors, each of shape (N,). Use only `torch` and `math`; do not import anything else.
2. Write staged rewards with tensor masks, not `if`/`else` on tensors, e.g. `staged = torch.where(ctx.lifted, r_hold, torch.zeros_like(r_hold))`.
3. Prefer bounded, smooth shaping such as `torch.exp(-k * dist)` or `1 - torch.tanh(k * dist)` instead of raw negative distances, so that no single term dominates.
4. Contact: `ctx.link_cup_force[:, f, k]` is the contact force between link k (0 the link moved by joint `_3`, 1 the link moved by joint `_4`, 2 the fingertip) of finger f (0 thumb, 1 index, 2 middle, 3 ring, 4 pinky) and the cup, and `ctx.palm_cup_force` the force between the palm and the cup. Contact is measured only on these links and the palm — the finger links nearest the palm are not measured. Contacts with anything else (the table, the hand itself) are not included. A value of 0 means that link is not touching the cup. Contact forces come from the physics engine each step and can spike. These forces are only available to the reward; the policy itself does not observe contact.
5. Cylinder geometry: for a point p (e.g. `ctx.link_pos[:, f, k]`), with `v = p - ctx.cup_pos`, the axial coordinate is `h = (v * ctx.cup_axis).sum(-1)` and the radial vector is `v - h.unsqueeze(-1) * ctx.cup_axis`; its norm is the distance from the cup axis. The cup surface is at `ctx.cup_radius` and the graspable band is `|h| <= ctx.cup_half_height`. The palm normal `ctx.palm_normal` points out of the palm.
6. Height: `ctx.cup_pos[:, 2] - ctx.cup_spawn_pos[:, 2]` is how far the cup has been raised above its starting height (0 while it rests on the table). `ctx.lifted` becomes True once that height exceeds `ctx.lift_latch_height` and stays True for the rest of the episode, even if the cup is dropped again.
7. Goal and success are computed by the environment and cannot be redefined by the reward. The goal position is 0.21 m to 0.28 m above the cup's starting position and at most 5 cm away from it horizontally, with the cup upright. A success is counted when `ctx.goal_dist <= ctx.success_tol` for `ctx.success_hold_steps` consecutive steps, and `ctx.success` is True on that step. After a success the next goal is at the same place, so holding the cup still there keeps producing successes until `ctx.max_successes`, which ends the episode. The keypoints are fixed on the cup, so tilting the cup also increases `goal_dist`. `ctx.success_tol` starts at 0.1125 m and shrinks towards 0.015 m as the policy succeeds more often during training. You may add a bonus on `ctx.success`.
8. An episode lasts at most 600 steps (10 s), and the step budget restarts after every success. The episode ends early when the cup falls below z = 0.15 (off the table), leaves the table area, or tilts more than 60 degrees; when any hand link goes more than 3 cm below the table top; or when an arm joint goes past its limit or moves faster than 20 rad/s. On that last kind of physics violation the environment also adds a fixed -1 to the reward, outside your function.
9. Do not keep any state between calls (no globals, no attributes); the function must be pure.
10. Each component you return is logged separately during training and may be shown back to you after training, so name components meaningfully (e.g. "approach", "lift", "success_bonus").

I want it to fulfil the following task: Grasp the upright cylindrical cup with an envelope grasp (a power grasp): bring the palm against the side of the cup and wrap all five fingers around it, with the thumb on the opposite side of the cup from the other four fingers, so that the palm and the links of every finger are in contact with the cup. Then lift the cup to the goal position and hold it there, upright and still, so that the environment keeps counting successes. Do not knock the cup over, do not drop it, and do not push the hand into the table.
1. Please think step by step and tell me what this task means and which stages the robot must go through.
2. Then write a function with exactly this signature:
```python
def compute_reward(ctx: RewardContext) -> tuple[torch.Tensor, dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    ...
    return reward, {"component_name": component_tensor, ...}
```
   where `reward` has shape (N,) and every dict value has shape (N,).
3. Take care of tensor shapes and types; never access a field or method that is not listed in the class definition above.
4. Put the final code in ONE ```python fenced block that starts with `import torch` and `import math` and contains only the function (plus small helper functions if needed). Add short comments explaining the weights.
