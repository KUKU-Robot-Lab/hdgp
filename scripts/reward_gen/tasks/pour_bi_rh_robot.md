We control a bimanual robot: two 7-DOF OpenArm arms, each carrying an Inspire RH56F1 five-finger \
hand, standing at a table. The RH56F1 is an UNDER-ACTUATED hand: only 6 joints per hand are driven \
(thumb abduction, thumb flexion, and one flexion drive for each of the index, middle, ring and pinky \
fingers); the remaining finger joints follow the driven ones through fixed mechanical couplings, so a \
finger always curls as a whole. The RIGHT arm is the "source" arm (src_*), the LEFT arm is the \
"receiver" arm (rcv_*). Two identical cups stand on the table: the source cup (in front of the right \
hand, filled with {num_beads} small beads) and the receiver cup (in front of the left hand, empty). \
Positions are in metres in a frame whose origin is at the robot base; +z is up, +x is forward (away \
from the robot), +y is to the robot's left. The table top is at z = table_z.

The action space is a normalized `Box(-1, 1, ({num_actions},), float32)`:
  actions[0:6]   = source palm 6-DoF target offset (xyz + yaw/pitch/roll) — the arm is moved \
by a geometric-fabrics controller toward this target
  actions[6:12]  = source hand closure commands, one per driven joint \
(thumb abduction, thumb flexion, index, middle, ring, pinky; 0 = open, 1 = closed)
  actions[12:18] = receiver palm 6-DoF target offset
  actions[18:24] = receiver hand closure commands
The hand controller stops a finger automatically once one of its links touches its own cup \
(contact freeze), so a closing command produces a wrap-around power grasp; opening is always \
allowed. Fingers can only close when the palm is near its cup. The hand opening between the thumb \
and the four fingers is about 10 cm when open and the cups are about 7 cm in diameter, so the cup \
must be placed well inside the hand before closing.
